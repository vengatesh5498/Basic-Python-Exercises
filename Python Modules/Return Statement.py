def multiply(number1,number2):
    result=number1*number2
    #A short form of this is
    #return number1*number2
    return result
#The above does not return result but executes the function.
#To return the result
x=multiply(5,8)
print(x)
#Or we can also return the result by
print(multiply(4,12))
